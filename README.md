## üìöPapers

### Head & Face Avatars

| Title | Model Input | What is Controllable | Real-Time? / Speed | Link | Contribution | Views Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEGA: Drivable 3D Gaussian Head Avatar from a Single Image** | Single image; using UV-space Gaussian framework + FLAME prior | Expression + view + identity; generalizes to unseen identities | Real-time performance claimed | [arXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14373) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |

### Full-Body / Clothed Avatars

| Title | Model Input | What is Controllable | Real-Time? / Speed | Link | Contribution | Views Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **(MM24)Animatable 3D Gaussian: Fast and High-Quality Reconstruction of Multiple Human Avatars** | video sequence of one or more humans along with their corresponding pose data $(S_t,T_t)$ for each frame. | novel view synthesis and novel pose synthesis | real-time claimed |[![PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-arXiv-b31b1b?style=for-the-badge.svg)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16482)<br>  [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-GitHub-8A2BE2?style=for-the-badge.svg)](https://github.com/jimmyYliu/Animatable-3d-Gaussian)| 1. Animatable 3D Gaussian: A new representation for dynamic humans that allows for fast, high-quality reconstruction without needing a specific shape prior like SMPL. 2. significantly faster (training in seconds) and uses less memory than previous state-of-the-art methods. 3. Dynamic Shadow Modeling. | monocular (single-view) or sparse multi-view video sequences |
| **(3DV25)D3GA - Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars** | 3D joint angles and facial keypoints | body, individual garments (like shirts and pants), and the face. | 1024√ó667 resolution, it achieves approximately 26 FPS | [![PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-arXiv-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08581)<br>  [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-GitHub-8A2BE2.svg)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/D3GA) | 1. A lightweight and composable avatar model using 3D Gaussians that are deformed by tetrahedral cages instead of standard Linear Blend Skinning (LBS). This allows for more natural stretching and re-orientation of the primitives. 2. The ability to use localized conditioning, meaning different parts of the avatar (e.g., face, body) can be driven by different input signals (e.g., keypoints, joint angles). | dense multi-view video captured in a studio setting. 200 cameras as well as a smaller 40-camera setup |

## üìãScope / What‚Äôs Included

This repository collects methods and resources that satisfy **all** of:

1. Use **3D Gaussian Splatting** (or methods clearly based on or extending 3DGS) as a core component.  
2. Target **avatars / dynamic humans** (head, face, full body, clothed, expression / pose animation).  
3. Support or demonstrate **dynamic / controllable outputs** (pose, expression, identity, view etc.).  

Excluded (for now):

- Static scenes / static objects without human / avatar elements.  
- Methods that use only 2D Gaussian Splatting without 3D extension.  
- Non-human characters unless specified.
