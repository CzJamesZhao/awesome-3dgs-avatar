## üìã Scope / What‚Äôs Included

This repository collects methods and resources that satisfy **all** of:

1. Use **3D Gaussian Splatting** (or methods clearly based on or extending 3DGS) as a core component.  
2. Target **avatars / dynamic humans** (head, face, full body, clothed, expression / pose animation).  
3. Support or demonstrate **dynamic / controllable outputs** (pose, expression, identity, view etc.).  

Excluded (for now):

- Static scenes / static objects without human / avatar elements.  
- Methods that use only 2D Gaussian Splatting without 3D extension.  
- Non-human characters unless specified.
