**Awesome 3D Gaussian Splatting → Avatars & Dynamic Humans**

A curated list of papers, implementations, datasets, demos, and resources focusing on **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** methods applied to **avatars / dynamic human modeling**: head avatars, full-body clothed avatars, expression & pose control, single-image / video / multi-view inputs, and real-time rendering.

⭐ If you like this list, give it a star! 😄

## 📋Scope / What’s Included

This repository collects methods and resources that satisfy **all** of:

1. Use **3D Gaussian Splatting** (or methods clearly based on or extending 3DGS) as a core component.  
2. Target **avatars / dynamic humans** (head, face, full body, clothed, expression / pose animation).  
3. Support or demonstrate **dynamic / controllable outputs** (pose, expression, identity, view etc.).  

Excluded (for now):

- Static scenes / static objects without human / avatar elements.  
- Methods that use only 2D Gaussian Splatting without 3D extension.  
- Non-human characters unless specified.
